# Lab 1 - Led Control

## Overview
This lab demonstrates the use of two RGB LEDs and a breadboard.  
The purpose of this lab is to get the basics of wiring and understanding of synchronization.

## Requirements
- Hardware:
  - jumper wires
  - breadboard
  - Arduino Uno
  - 2 RGB LEDs  [List your components, e.g., Arduino Uno, DHT11 sensor, breadboard, jumper wires]

## Results
- Me and Dane were able to have the code make color fading effects between multiple colors.
- Able to make the LED blink.
- Understood how resistors effect the output of brightness
