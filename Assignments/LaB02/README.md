# Lab 2 - Soldering with a Ultraonic LED level meter

## Overview
In this lab, we demonstrate the use of how a ultrasonic level meter works and use LEDs to indicate distance. 
Towards the end, we then apply the skills of soldering  our design to a pcb board.
The purpose of this lab is to get behind the basics of soldering, sensor control, and simple coding.
