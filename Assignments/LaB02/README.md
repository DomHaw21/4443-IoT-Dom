# Lab 2 - Soldering with a Ultraonic LED level meter

## Overview
In this lab, we demonstrate the use of how a ultrasonic level meter works and use LEDs to indicate distance. 
Towards the end, we then apply the skills of soldering  our design to a pcb board.
The purpose of this lab is to get behind the basics of soldering, sensor control, and simple coding.

## Requirements
- Hardware:
  - jumper wires
  - breadboard
  - pcb board
  - soldering kit
  - Arduino Uno
  - 6 LEDs: 2 red, 2 yellow, 2 green

## Results
- Was able to make LED zones based on proximity, and so the closer an object got, the more LED zones light up from red being close and green being far.
- Also able to properly solder components to a pcb board.
